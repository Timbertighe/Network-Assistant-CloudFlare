# CloudFlare plugin
Handles webhooks from the CloudFlare platform

# Using the plugin
Plugins need to be added to the 'plugins' directory of the Network Assistant, each in their own folder.
Plugins are then enabled in the global configuration file

## Webhooks
### Enabling Webhooks
    This requires webhook alerts to be configured on CloudFlare
    This uses a global webhook definition
    Then, enable the webhook as an alert destination on individual services
    
### Webhook Authentication
    CloudFlare webook authentication uses the 'cf-webhook-auth' header
    This contains a secret that is defined in the cloudflare platform
    This secret is sent in plain text
    

## Configuration
### Overview
    Plugin configuration is in the 'config.yaml' file
    
#### Plugin Config
    Set 'webhook_secret' to the secret, as set in the CloudFlare webhook configuration
    Set the 'auth_header' to cf-webhook-auth
